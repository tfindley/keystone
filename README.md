> **In one line.** FitSD is just enough process for a small team to take on the right work and ship it so it lasts — one front door for new work, and a "done" that means *operable*, not merely running.

Small teams can't run ITIL — it assumes a department and a budget for process nobody has. But they still have to decide what's worth building, design it so it can actually be run, and avoid the 2 a.m. call-out for something nobody wrote down. FitSD is the smallest amount of that discipline a handful of people can keep up. New work enters through one front door with two quick decision gates — *is this worth doing?* then *is it ready to build?* — and nothing goes live until it's proven ready: documented, recoverable, secure, monitored, supportable. It keeps what ITIL, ISO 20000 and FitSM get right, and drops everything a small team can't sustain.

Two things do most of the work:

- **One front door.** New work comes in through a single intake and two light decision gates. Nothing gets built on a whim.
- **Readiness built in.** Nothing reaches live service until it's documented, recoverable, secure, monitored and supportable — not just running.

It's a personal project, and it's deliberately not tied to any one organisation. Released under **CC BY 4.0** (see `LICENSE`).

## How to read this

You don't need to read it all — pick your path:

- **Just curious?** → `FitSD — Quickstart.md` — one project, five moves.
- **Pitching it upward?** → `FitSD — Elevator Pitch & Executive Summary.md`.
- **Adopting it?** → `FitSD — Framework Charter.md` (what it is) → `FitSD — Requirements.md` (what you must meet) → `capabilities/solution-development/` (the one fully built process).
- **Checking it against standards?** → `reference/FitSD — Standards Alignment.md`.
- **Stuck on a term?** → `FitSD — Definitions.md`.

## What's in here

> **Tiers** — 0–1 are the portable **Framework** (what FitSD *is*); 2–5 are the **Implementation** (how a team does it). See the Charter, §5.

Solution Development is built out in full — a process and its forms (intake, two gates, and acceptance). The other four each have a **capability card** — a one-page orientation, not a full process: what it governs, the requirements it carries, and which existing standard or process to satisfy them with. That's the design — FitSD tells you *what* good looks like and lets you keep the *how* you already have.

## Where it's at

v0.2, founding layer (hardened) — with **v0.3 in progress** on the `v0.3` branch. The charter and requirements are drafted; Solution Development has its full process and forms (intake, two gates, acceptance); the other four capabilities have cards. v0.2 added the full service lifecycle (end-of-life review & retirement), the information-stores layer, continuity in the Definition of Done, and a new-technology intake control. v0.3 reframes the SAC as an inheritable, org-ratified baseline (FSD-GV-7), adds the Idea Brief form (FSD-FRM-00) and a business Implementation Guide, and simplifies the Solution Development forms. The roles model (Tier 3), the maturity self-check (Tier 5) and a worked example are next — see `BACKLOG.md` and `FitSD — Roadmap.md`.
