# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues — in the FitSD website or this repository — via the
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/tfindley/keystone/security/advisories/new)
page, or the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tfindley/keystone/issues) for
non-sensitive reports.

A machine-readable contact is published at
<https://fitsd.tfindley.dev/.well-known/security.txt> (RFC 9116).

## Scope

This repository holds the FitSD standard (Markdown) and the website that publishes it
(`web/`). The site is a static build served by nginx behind Traefik; its security posture
— headers, Content-Security-Policy, supply chain and hosting — is documented and published
at <https://fitsd.tfindley.dev/compliance/security/>.
