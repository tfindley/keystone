# FitSD — Requirements

> **Status: v0.1 draft, founding layer.** This is Tier 1 of FitSD — the testable spine. Each requirement is a "shall" statement that an implementation must satisfy to conform, by whatever local documents and tools it chooses (see *Charter* §7). Requirements are grouped by the five capabilities. IDs are stable; wording will be refined.

## How to read this

Each requirement has an ID (`FSD-XX-n`), a statement, and where useful a short note on intent. Conformance is about the *requirement* being met and evidenced — not about adopting any particular template. Keep the set small: a requirement that does not change a decision does not belong here.

**Two registers of depth.** FitSD owns only the *requirements* — these thin, outcome-based "shall" statements. It deliberately does **not** build a process for every capability. The *how* is satisfied one of two ways: (a) a **FitSD reference capability** (a Tier 2 process doc — shipped only for the flagship, Solution Development), or (b) a **reference to an existing process or standard** the team already runs (its own change- or incident-management policy, or ITIL / FitSM). Each capability names where its "how" lives. This is how FitSD can require change, incident, security and the rest **without rebuilding those disciplines**.

## FSD-GV — Govern

The management system itself.

**Reference (how satisfied):** met directly by your scope, document-control, roles and review practices — FitSD ships no separate process. Maps to FitSM GR1–GR9, ITIL SVS governance, ISO 27001 clauses 4–10.

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                          | Note                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **FSD-GV-1** | The scope of services under management **shall** be defined and recorded.                                            | What is in and out of the system.           |
| **FSD-GV-2** | Each service **shall** have a single named owner accountable for it.                                                 | Roles may be shared; accountability is not. |
| **FSD-GV-3** | Documents that govern services **shall** be version-controlled, each with an owner, an approver, and a review cycle. | Document control.                           |
| **FSD-GV-4** | A register of services and key records **shall** be maintained and kept current.                                     | The system's index.                         |
| **FSD-GV-5** | The management system **shall** be reviewed at a defined cadence and improved (Plan-Do-Check-Act).                   | Continual improvement.                      |
| **FSD-GV-6** | Roles **shall** be defined, including who may authorise what.                                                        | One person may hold several.                |

## FSD-SD — Bring in (Solution Development)

The front door. How net-new work enters and reaches live service.

**Reference (how satisfied):** the one capability FitSD ships in full — `FSD-PRO` plus the Gate and Acceptance forms (Tier 2/4). This is the framework's flagship; everything else references out.

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Note                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **FSD-SD-1** | Net-new services **shall** enter through a defined intake before build effort is committed.                                                                                                                           | A scope test separates this from routine change. |
| **FSD-SD-2** | A new service **shall** pass a value/feasibility decision before design begins.                                                                                                                                       | Gate 1 — "worth doing?"                          |
| **FSD-SD-3** | A new service **shall** pass a design-readiness decision before delivery, covering how it will be operated.                                                                                                           | Gate 2 — "ready to build?"                       |
| **FSD-SD-4** | Every new or materially changed service **shall** meet a defined Service Acceptance / Definition of Done before entering live service, **evidenced** rather than asserted.                                            | Readiness baked in.                              |
| **FSD-SD-5** | Service Acceptance **shall**, as a minimum, cover: documentation; tested backup and recoverability; security; access control; availability; monitoring and alerting; service-level incident triggers; supportability and handover; and cost/licensing. | The Definition of Done (see FSD-PRO §7); the set may grow as practice matures. Incident triggers also satisfy FSD-RR-6. |
| **FSD-SD-6** | Each gate and acceptance decision **shall** have a single accountable approver and be recorded.                                                                                                                       | Lightweight, single-approver by default.         |

## FSD-CH — Change & release

Changing live services safely.

**Reference (how satisfied):** FitSD states the requirements only and does **not** build a change-management process. Satisfy them with your existing change/CAB process or an external standard — ITIL 4 *Change enablement*, FitSM PR12.

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                    | Note                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **FSD-CH-1** | Changes to live services **shall** be assessed for risk and impact before implementation.      |                              |
| **FSD-CH-2** | Changes **shall** be authorised by an authority appropriate to their risk.                     | Standard/normal/major tiers. |
| **FSD-CH-3** | Changes **shall** be recorded, and significant changes reviewed after implementation.          |                              |
| **FSD-CH-4** | Releases **shall** be deployed in a controlled, repeatable, and where feasible reversible way. |                              |

## FSD-RR — Run & restore

Keeping services healthy.

**Reference (how satisfied):** FitSD does **not** build incident or problem management — most organisations run a **central incident-management policy**. Satisfy via that policy (or ITIL *Incident / Problem / Monitoring and event*, FitSM PR9/PR10/PR4). FitSD's distinct contribution is to require each *service* to plug into it — see FSD-RR-6.

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                 | Note                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **FSD-RR-1** | Service-affecting events **shall** be detected, recorded, prioritised and resolved against defined targets. | Via the incident-management process. |
| **FSD-RR-2** | Major incidents **shall** have a defined escalation and communication path.                                 | Usually the central incident-management policy. |
| **FSD-RR-3** | Recurring or high-impact incidents **shall** be investigated for root cause.                                | Problem management.  |
| **FSD-RR-4** | Services **shall** be monitored against expected availability, and capacity managed ahead of need.          |                      |
| **FSD-RR-5** | Security patches **shall** be assessed and applied within risk-based timescales.                            |                      |
| **FSD-RR-6** | Each service **shall** declare a **service-level incident profile** — what constitutes an incident *for that service*, with triggers and severities — registered with the incident-management process. | The gap most orgs have: central policy defines "an incident" generically; the per-service triggers are rarely written down. Defined at Service Acceptance (SAC), consumed by the central process. |

## FSD-SA — Secure & assure

Staying safe and compliant.

**Reference (how satisfied):** met by your information-security and risk practices — FitSD ships no separate process here. Maps to ISO 27001 Annex A, FitSM PR6, ITIL *Information security / Risk management*. (Supplier / supply-chain — **FSD-SC** — is on the backlog, closing NIS2 21(2)(d).)

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                  | Note                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **FSD-SA-1** | Risks to services **shall** be identified, recorded in a register, and treated or formally accepted by an accountable owner. |                           |
| **FSD-SA-2** | Access **shall** follow least privilege, with joiners/movers/leavers handled and access reviewed periodically.               |                           |
| **FSD-SA-3** | Data **shall** be backed up to a defined scheme, and recoverability tested — not assumed.                                    | Ties to FSD-SD-5.          |
| **FSD-SA-4** | Departures from policy **shall** be handled as recorded, time-bound, compensated exceptions.                                 |                           |
| **FSD-SA-5** | Service management **shall** align to applicable legal and regulatory obligations, with evidence of control retained.        | e.g. NIS2-style measures. |

## Reference documents (non-normative)

FitSD ships reference documents for its flagship **Solution Development** capability, which implementers may adopt and adapt:

- **Solution Development Process** — the two-gate process plus Service Acceptance close-out (satisfies FSD-SD-1…6).
- **Gate 1 — Outline Proposal** form.
- **Gate 2 — Solution Design** form.
- **Service Acceptance Record** — the Definition of Done (satisfies FSD-SD-5).

These are illustrative reference material, not part of the normative requirements above. An implementation conforms by meeting the requirements, however it chooses to document them.

*Coverage note: FSD-GV and FSD-SD are the founding spine. FSD-CH / FSD-RR / FSD-SA are stated here so the requirement set is complete, but their reference capabilities (Tier 2) come later.*
