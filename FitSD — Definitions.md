# FitSD — Definitions

> A master glossary. Each FitSD document defines the terms it uses where it uses them — that's deliberate, so a document stands alone. This is the single place that gathers them all, plus the common industry terms and acronyms FitSD leans on. Cheap to keep, handy to have. Non-normative: nothing here adds a requirement.

## FitSD terms

**Capability.** One of the five areas FitSD organises service management into: Govern, Bring in (Solution Development), Change & release, Run & restore, Secure & assure.

**Capability card.** A one-page orientation for a capability — its objective, the requirements it carries, what to satisfy them with, and how it connects to Solution Development. Built for the four capabilities FitSD doesn't author a full process for.

**Gate.** A decision point with explicit outcomes — go, hold, or stop. Work doesn't pass a gate until it's signed off.

**Gate 1 (Outline Proposal).** The first gate: *is this worth doing?* A light filter, before any design effort.

**Gate 2 (Solution Design).** The second gate: *is it ready to build?* The design, including how it will be run.

**Implementation profile.** A team's local version of FitSD — their actual documents and tools, mapped to the requirements.

**Net-new.** Work that meets the intake test (a new service or capability, new infrastructure, material effort or ongoing cost). The line that separates Solution Development work from routine change.

**Primary driver.** Why a piece of work is proposed: value, compliance, or risk reduction. For compliance- and risk-driven work, the case rests on impact and the obligation, not on the value score.

**Proof of Concept (PoC).** A small, time-boxed experiment to settle genuine feasibility doubt. Identified at Gate 1; done before Gate 2 if needed.

**Requirement.** A testable "shall" statement that must be met to conform to FitSD (Tier 1).

**Service.** Something the team provides and then runs and supports — not something built once and forgotten.

**Service Acceptance.** The close-out at the end of delivery: proof, with evidence, that a service is ready before it goes live.

**Service Acceptance Criteria (SAC) / Definition of Done.** The standard set of conditions a service must meet to be accepted: documentation, tested backup, security, access, availability, monitoring & alerting, incident profile, supportability, cost/licensing.

**Solution Owner.** The single person accountable for a proposed solution, who drives it through the gates and completes the records.

**Approver.** The role that signs off the gates and Service Acceptance, at a level matched to the risk.

**Incident profile.** What counts as an incident for a *specific* service — its triggers and severities — registered with the incident process. Defined at Service Acceptance.

**Tier (0–5).** FitSD's document layers: 0 charter & vocabulary, 1 requirements, 2 capabilities, 3 roles, 4 templates, 5 maturity self-check. Tiers 0–1 are the framework; 2–5 are how a team implements it.

**Demand register (pipeline).** The record of work in the front-door pipeline — proposed, parked, rejected and in-flight — giving the upcoming/in-flight view. Becomes the service register once work goes live. See *FitSD — Information Stores*.

**Information store.** Any register or record set FitSD relies on, described by what it holds and who owns it — not by which tool holds it. Gathered in *FitSD — Information Stores*.

**End-of-life (EOL) review.** The decision taken when a service reaches end of life (EOL/EOS, obsolescence, or no longer needed): **renew** (keep running), **replace** (function still needed — back through the front door as new demand), or **retire** (decommission). See FSD-RR-7.

**Retirement (decommission).** The controlled close-out of a service no longer needed: data handled, access revoked, SLAs withdrawn, documentation archived, the register updated, and operating knowledge captured. See FSD-RR-7.

**Continuity (operational knowledge).** The assurance that a live service isn't reliant on a single person — its operating knowledge is captured and shared (cross-training, runbooks). Proven at Service Acceptance under supportability/handover.

## Common terms & acronyms

**BAU.** Business as usual — routine, day-to-day running and change.

**CAB.** Change Advisory Board — a group that reviews and authorises changes. FitSD doesn't mandate one; it's one way to meet the Change requirements.

**CAPEX / OPEX.** Capital expenditure (one-off purchase cost) and operating expenditure (ongoing run cost).

**DORA (four key metrics).** From the *Accelerate* research: deployment frequency, lead time for change, change-fail rate, and time to restore service. FitSD points at these as its flow measures.

**EOL / EOS.** End of life / end of support — when a product stops being maintained, a common trigger for new work.

**Given / When / Then.** A plain way to write a testable criterion: *given* a situation, *when* something happens, *then* this should result. Borrowed from behaviour-driven development.

**JML.** Joiners, movers, leavers — the lifecycle of granting, changing and removing a person's access.

**Kanban / WIP limit.** A way of managing flow by capping the amount of work in progress, so the team's constraint isn't swamped. FitSD's gates act as a WIP limit on intake.

**MFA.** Multi-factor authentication.

**MoSCoW.** A way to prioritise requirements: **Must** (non-negotiable), **Should** (important but not vital), **Could** (nice to have if there's room), **Won't** (not this time). Credited to Dai Clegg.

**MTTR.** Mean time to restore (or repair) — how quickly service is brought back after an incident.

**MVP.** Minimum viable product — the smallest version that delivers real value.

**OIDC / SSO.** OpenID Connect / single sign-on — letting people authenticate once, through an identity provider.

**PDCA.** Plan-Do-Check-Act — the improvement cycle behind continual improvement (Deming/Shewhart).

**PoC.** See *Proof of Concept* above.

**RAID / RAIDD log.** A running list of Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies — and, in the longer form, Decisions. A standard project-tracking tool.

**RACI.** A responsibility matrix: who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed for each activity.

**SLA / SLO.** Service-level agreement (a commitment to a customer) / service-level objective (an internal target).

**T-shirt sizing.** Rough estimation in sizes — S, M, L — rather than precise numbers, used when detail isn't known yet.

**Theory of Constraints (ToC).** The idea that a system moves at the speed of its bottleneck — so find it, protect it, and don't overload it. From Goldratt's *The Goal*.

**Three Ways.** The principles of *The Phoenix Project*: flow, feedback, and continual learning.

**ZTNA.** Zero-trust network access — granting access per session and per service, rather than broad network access after a single login.

## Standards & frameworks referenced

**FitSM.** A free, lightweight ITSM standard. FitSD's closest cousin and the inspiration for its name.

**ISO/IEC 20000.** The international standard for IT service management systems.

**ISO/IEC 27001.** The international standard for information security management systems (ISMS).

**ITIL.** A widely used body of IT service-management practice (currently ITIL 4).

**ISMS.** Information security management system — the management framework ISO 27001 certifies.

**ITSM.** IT service management — running IT as a set of services.

**NIS2.** EU Directive (2022/2555) setting cybersecurity risk-management and reporting duties for in-scope organisations.

**USM / VeriSM.** A lean service-management *method* (USM) and a digital-era service-management approach (VeriSM); both compatible with, but organised differently from, FitSD.
