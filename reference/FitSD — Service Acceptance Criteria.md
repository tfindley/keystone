# FitSD — Service Acceptance Criteria

> **What this is.** The single canonical home of the Service Acceptance Criteria (SAC) — the standing Definition of Done every solution is held to. It states the *categories* and what each one is for, and gives an organisation a template to set its *own* thresholds and ratify them once. Non-normative: the criteria are elaborated here, but the "shall" that makes them binding lives in *FitSD — Requirements* (the standing-baseline requirement and FSD-SD-4/5). The process proves them (`FSD-PRO §7`); the forms design and evidence them (`FSD-FRM-02 §5`, `FSD-FRM-03 §1`); this document is where they are *defined*.

## The SAC are principles, not one org's numbers

The SAC are best understood as **standing, inheritable non-functional principles**. The *categories* below are fixed — they are the shape of "operable" that FitSD holds every service to. The *thresholds* are not: every organisation's acceptable service-quality bar differs — its availability target, its backup-test cadence, its continuity rule, what it counts as a reportable incident, its cost and licensing posture.

So an adopter shouldn't inherit *our* numbers. They inherit the *categories*, then set their own thresholds **once**, ratify them as the organisation's standing non-functional baseline, and **inherit that baseline into every solution** — designed to at Gate 2, proven at Service Acceptance. This is the shift-left of non-functional requirements: teams design *to* a known bar instead of discovering it at go-live.

Defining the set in one place is also what keeps it from drifting. The criteria are referenced **by name** wherever they appear; the set is versioned with the framework; no document states a count.

## The criteria

Each criterion is described here by *what it covers* — stage-neutral. It is **designed** at Gate 2 (how the baseline will be met) and **proven** at Service Acceptance (evidence the baseline is met). Those stage-specific bars live on the forms, not here.

| Criterion | What it covers | What your baseline sets |
|---|---|---|
| **Documentation** | The service can be understood and operated from written material — design, runbook, recovery procedure, user/how-to. | Which documents are mandatory, and where they live. |
| **Backup (tested)** | Data is recoverable, and recovery is demonstrated rather than assumed. | Backup scope, frequency, retention, location — and how often a restore is actually tested. |
| **Security** | The service is hardened, has a patch path, and its vulnerability posture is acceptable, with any departures recorded. | The hardening standard, patch timescales by severity, and what "acceptable posture" means (ties to FSD-SA). |
| **Access** | Access follows least privilege, with joiners/movers/leavers handled and access reviewed. | The access model and the review cadence (ties to FSD-SA-2). |
| **Availability** | The service meets an agreed availability target, with capacity and disaster-recovery understood. | The availability target / SLO (by service tier, if you tier) and the DR position. |
| **Monitoring & alerting** | The service is observed, with thresholds and alert routing that work end to end. | What must be monitored, the thresholds, and where alerts route. |
| **Incident profile** | What counts as an incident *for this service* is defined and registered with the incident process. | The severity scheme and the reportable-incident bar (satisfies FSD-RR-6). |
| **Supportability / handover** | An operating and support model exists, and **continuity** is assured — the service isn't reliant on a single person. | The support model, and the continuity rule (cross-training / knowledge capture). |
| **Cost / licensing** | Licences are in place and ongoing run-cost is owned. | The licensing posture and who owns the run-cost. |

The set may grow as practice matures — a new criterion is a framework change, versioned like any other.

## Your SAC baseline

Set this once, ratify it, and inherit it into every solution. The prompts below are **questions, not answers** — FitSD ships no default numbers, on purpose. Fill them with values that fit *your* organisation and risk appetite. (Worked example values will follow the published end-to-end example — see *FitSD — Roadmap*.)

| Criterion | Your standard — set once, ratified | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| **Documentation** | *Which documents are mandatory; where they live* | |
| **Backup (tested)** | *Backup scope; frequency; retention; how often a restore is tested* | |
| **Security** | *Hardening standard; patch timescales by severity; acceptable vulnerability posture* | |
| **Access** | *Access model; least-privilege rules; how often access is reviewed* | |
| **Availability** | *Availability target / SLO (by tier, if you tier); DR position* | |
| **Monitoring & alerting** | *What must be monitored; thresholds; where alerts route* | |
| **Incident profile** | *Severity scheme; what counts as a reportable incident* | |
| **Supportability / handover** | *Support model; the continuity rule (no single-person dependency)* | |
| **Cost / licensing** | *Licensing posture; who owns ongoing run-cost* | |

**Ratification.** A baseline is only standing once it's owned.

| Field | Entry |
|---|---|
| **Ratified by** | *(the accountable owner — e.g. Management System Owner)* |
| **Date** | |
| **Review cadence** | *(tie to your management-system review — FSD-GV-5)* |

## How the baseline flows

- **Idea Brief (FSD-FRM-00)** — referenced, not re-specified: the brief names the SAC baseline as the service-quality expectation and notes any project-specific emphasis, so quality shapes selection from the start.
- **Gate 2 (FSD-FRM-02 §5)** — *designed*: how each criterion will be met against the baseline.
- **Service Acceptance (FSD-FRM-03 §1)** — *proven*: evidence each criterion meets the baseline before the service goes live.

Standing up the baseline for the first time is an explicit step in *FitSD — Implementation Guide*.
