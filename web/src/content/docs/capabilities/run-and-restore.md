*Capability card. Keep live services healthy, and get them back fast when they break.*

> **What a capability card is.** A one-page orientation, not a process — what the capability is for, the requirements it carries, what to satisfy them *with*, and how it wires into Solution Development. FitSD authors a full process only for Solution Development; the rest are requirements plus a pointer.

## Objective

Detect when something's wrong, fix it fast, and stop it happening twice. This is the day-to-day reality of running services: incidents, the occasional bad day that becomes a major incident, the recurring faults worth chasing to root cause, and the monitoring and patching that keep the lights on.

## Scope

**In:** incidents and major incidents, problems, monitoring and availability, capacity, patching, each service's incident profile, and **end-of-life review & retirement**. **Out:** building new services (Solution Development) and changing them (Change & Release).

## Requirements it carries (Tier 1)

- **FSD-RR-1** — service-affecting events detected, recorded, prioritised and resolved to targets.
- **FSD-RR-2** — major incidents have a defined escalation and communication path.
- **FSD-RR-3** — recurring or high-impact incidents investigated for root cause.
- **FSD-RR-4** — services monitored against expected availability; capacity managed ahead of need.
- **FSD-RR-5** — security patches assessed and applied to risk-based timescales.
- **FSD-RR-6** — each service declares its incident profile — what counts as an incident *for it*, with severities — registered with the incident process.
- **FSD-RR-7** — at end of life, a renew / replace / retire decision is recorded; retirement is carried out cleanly (data, access, SLAs, docs, register, knowledge).

## How to satisfy them

Most teams already run a central incident policy — use it. Map onto:

- **FitSM PR9 (Incident & Service Request), PR10 (Problem), PR4 (Availability & Continuity), PR5 (Capacity).**
- **ITIL 4 Incident, Problem, and Monitoring & Event management.**
- **Your central incident-management policy** for the escalation and comms path.

FitSD's distinct contributions here are two. **FSD-RR-6** — the per-service incident profile: central policies define "an incident" in the abstract; almost nobody writes down what it means for *this* service (FitSD makes you, at Service Acceptance). And **FSD-RR-7** — controlled end-of-life: most teams have no clean way to retire a service, so they never quite do; FitSD makes the renew / replace / retire decision explicit and the decommission controlled.

## Where it meets Solution Development

The Service Acceptance criteria are the hand-over. **Monitoring & alerting**, the **incident profile**, and the **supportability / handover** all pass from a new service into Run & Restore the moment it's accepted. And the loop closes at end of life (FSD-RR-7): a service is reviewed and either **renewed** (keep running), **replaced** (the function's still needed — back through the front door as fresh demand) or **retired** (decommissioned cleanly). What you learn running a service — a nasty incident, a capacity ceiling — also comes back round as new demand.

## The feedback lens

This is the *Second Way* of *The Phoenix Project*: fast feedback, right to left. See problems as they happen, restore quickly, and feed what you learn back upstream. The metric is **time to restore service** — one of the DORA four — and the cultural habit is the **blameless postmortem**, which is really just problem management (FSD-RR-3) done without finger-pointing.

## Maturity, briefly

- **0–1** — incidents handled by whoever's nearest; little record, no root-cause habit.
- **2–3** — defined incident and problem paths, monitoring in place, patches kept up.
- **4–5** — MTTR watched and falling; recurring problems designed out, not just fixed.

(Full 0–5 scale in the Charter, §7.)
