# FitSD deliberately references the SAC by NAME, never by number (the v0.2
# "de-number the SAC" decision), so the set can never drift the way GitHub
# issue #7 described. A number-word immediately before "SAC" / "criteria" /
# "criterion" is the smell this catches — e.g. "the eight SAC", "nine criteria".

# Run:   bash scripts/check-sac-drift.sh
# Exit:  0 = clean, 1 = a count was found (fix it: reference the criteria by name).
