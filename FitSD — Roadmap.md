# FitSD — Roadmap

> The direction of travel. Bigger-picture than the `BACKLOG` (which is the task list) — this is the why and the where. Rough on purpose; a personal project moves when it moves.

## Now (v0.2) — shipped

- The **Framework** layer (Tiers 0–1): the charter and the requirements.
- All five capabilities: Solution Development built in full (process + three forms); capability cards for Govern, Change & Release, Run & Restore, Secure & Assure.
- The supporting layer: an elevator pitch & executive summary, adoption & positioning, standards alignment, influences, quickstart, definitions, diagrams, and a licence.
- **v0.2 hardening:** lifecycle completion (end-of-life review & retirement — FSD-RR-7), the **information-stores** layer (every register/record made explicit and tech-agnostic), the demand pipeline + retained history in FSD-GV-4, continuity in the Definition of Done, and the new-technology intake trigger.

## In progress

- **A first worked example.** A real project run end to end, to Service Acceptance — *not yet written.* It's the single highest-value missing piece: the Adoption doc (§7) argues a messy, real worked example persuades better than any amount of spec, and it's the only honest source for SAC samples. *(Previously listed under "Now"; it isn't done, so it sits here until it lands.)*

## Next — the unbuilt tiers

Two **Implementation**-layer tiers are named in the Charter (§5) but not yet built. The guideposts below say *what each is, what "done" looks like, and the calls to make before drafting* — not the drafts themselves.

### Tier 5 — Maturity self-check

**What it is.** A Tier 5 document (`FitSD — Maturity Self-Check`) that lets a team score itself 0–5 on each capability, see the resulting profile at a glance, and read off the *one notch better* next step. The Adoption doc (§7) frames it as the no-bureaucracy answer to FitSM's Foundation/Advanced/Expert ladder — "a compass, not a certificate." It's the last missing rung of the adoption journey.

**Why it's close to buildable.** Most of the raw material already exists: the generic 0–5 scale is in *Charter* §7, and every capability card already carries a "Maturity, briefly" thumbnail (0–1 / 2–3 / 4–5). The build is mostly *consolidation plus mechanics* — expanding those thumbnails into anchored per-level descriptors and adding a way to score and read the result.

**What "done" looks like.**

- A per-capability rubric (GV, SD, CH, RR, SA — SC when it lands) with concrete, observable descriptors for each level 0–5, not vibes. Anchor each level to evidence a team could actually point at.
- A scoring method and a one-glance output — a heatmap table or a Mermaid radar — showing the capability profile.
- Interpretation guidance that carries the Charter's principle through: nobody's expected to hit 5 everywhere; "good enough for now" is a valid score *if it was a deliberate, recorded call.*
- A worked self-assessment (ideally scored from the real worked example, once it exists).

**Calls to make before drafting.**

- **Granularity:** score per capability (light) or per requirement (precise)? Lean per-capability, using the Tier 1 requirements as the evidence prompts behind each score.
- **Output format:** heatmap table vs radar chart — pick what renders cleanly on GitHub *and* in Obsidian.
- **Cadence:** tie the self-check to the FSD-GV-5 review cadence rather than inventing a new ritual.
- **Evidence prompts:** give each level a "you can show…" cue so scoring resists self-flattery.

**Effort & sequencing.** Small–medium; much of it is consolidation. Realistically a single focused pass once the granularity/format calls are made — this one could be greenlit for a real build now rather than waiting. No hard dependencies; benefits from the worked example for a real sample score, but doesn't block on it.

### Tier 3 — Roles model

**What it is.** A Tier 3 document (`FitSD — Roles`) that makes the role model canonical: each role's purpose and responsibilities, the *authority* it carries (who may approve what, at what level of risk), and how the roles collapse onto a handful of people — without ever doubling up accountability. Principle 3 already states the spirit: "one person, many hats… but every service has exactly one accountable owner."

**Why it needs a guidepost first.** Unlike Tier 5, this one needs genuine design decisions, and there's an existing naming tension to resolve before drafting: *Charter* §6 names **Service Owner** and **Operator**; *FSD-PRO* §3 names **Solution Owner** and **Contributors**. Is the Solution Owner (drives the gates) the same accountability as the Service Owner (owns it once live), at two lifecycle stages? That has to be nailed down, not discovered mid-draft.

**What "done" looks like.**

- One reconciled role set, merging *Charter* §6 and *FSD-PRO* §3, each role with purpose, responsibilities, and the authority it holds.
- An explicit lifecycle hand-off: how the **Solution Owner** becomes (or hands to) the **Service Owner** at Service Acceptance — the register entry (FSD-GV-4) names the live Service Owner.
- A lightweight responsibility map (RACI or similar) across the five capabilities' key activities — kept proportionate, not a matrix for its own sake.
- "One person, many hats" collapsing guidance with worked examples (e.g. who holds what on a 3-person team), plus the minimum that must *not* collapse (a builder shouldn't solely accept their own work — the light segregation-of-duties line that keeps NIS2 / ISO honest).

**Calls to make before drafting.**

- **Owner reconciliation:** Solution Owner → Service Owner as one accountability across stages (recommended), or two distinct roles with a hand-off?
- **Approver authority:** define risk/cost tiers for who must approve what, or keep the deliberately informal "single approver by default" of FSD-SD-6?
- **RACI granularity:** per capability vs per key activity — keep it light enough that a small team actually fills it in.
- **Minimum viable role set:** which roles are mandatory (Owner + Approver?) and which are optional or named-only on a tiny team.

**Effort & sequencing.** Medium — more design than Tier 5, and it touches existing docs (the Owner reconciliation ripples into FSD-PRO and the Charter). Light dependencies, but worth landing before or alongside Tier 5: the maturity self-check scores FSD-GV-6 (roles defined) and FSD-GV-2 (single owner), so a settled role model makes those scores meaningful.

### Also queued

- **Supplier / supply-chain capability (FSD-SC).** The one capability not yet stubbed; closes the NIS2 21(2)(d) gap and the ISO 27001 A.5.19–A.5.22 mapping. The likely "sixth capability," for teams with genuine supply-chain exposure. Card + requirements first, mirroring the other four; threads into Solution Development at Gate 2 (supplier assessment) and Service Acceptance.
- **SAC topic guidance / samples.** Short "how to write a good X criterion" notes per Service Acceptance criterion — deliberately deferred until the worked example lands, so the samples are real, not invented.
- **Gate 2 "selected option" field** on FSD-FRM-02 — the clean seam between the options evaluation and the design.

## Later — positioning and reach

Where FitSD earns a wider audience. One story in particular is worth telling.

**Controlling technology sprawl.** Startups and small teams accrue tools the way a loft accrues boxes. Every new thing solves a real problem the day it arrives — and then quietly becomes the permanent responsibility of the one or two people who put it in. Nobody owns it at the company level. Nobody wrote down what "supported" means. When those people move on, it turns into a haunted house: load-bearing software no one alive understands.

FitSD is, almost by accident, the cure. Its front door asks "is this worth taking on, and who owns it once it's live?" *before* the tool arrives. Its Definition of Done makes documentation, an owner and a support model conditions of going live, not afterthoughts. Its service register puts a name against every adopted technology. That's a sharp, relatable pitch — *stop your stack becoming a liability* — and a way to reach the startup audience who'd never open an ITSM standard but feel this pain every day.

Worth turning into a short article or positioning piece once the framework is public.

## Someday / maybe

- An open, GitHub-first release.
- A "FitSD in an afternoon" walkthrough, built on a worked example.
- Community contributions: more worked examples, more implementation profiles.
