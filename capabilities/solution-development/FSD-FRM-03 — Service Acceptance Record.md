# FSD-FRM-03 — Service Acceptance Record

> **Service Acceptance asks: is it proven done?** A solution is accepted into service only when each Service Acceptance Criterion is met **and evidenced** — not merely configured. The approaches were designed at Gate 2 (FSD-FRM-02); here they are proven. The live copy is held in the team's work-tracking system; this is the blank template.

## Header

| Field                            | Entry |
| -------------------------------- | ----- |
| **Solution title**               |       |
| **Solution Owner**               |       |
| **Delivery project (ref)**       |       |

| **Date**                         |       |

## 1. Acceptance criteria

For each criterion, record the evidence (a link, a date, a reference) and whether it is met.

| Criterion | Evidence / link | Met? (Y/N) |
|---|---|---|
| **Documentation** — HLD, runbook, recovery procedure, user/how-to published | | |
| **Backup (tested)** — backup in place **and test restore performed**, dated | | |
| **Security** — hardening applied, patch path set (FSD-RR), vuln posture acceptable, exceptions logged (FSD-SA) | | |
| **Access** — access model implemented; least privilege; JML handling confirmed | | |
| **Availability** — SLO met or accepted; capacity & scaling understood; DR position recorded | | |
| **Monitoring & alerting** — monitoring live; thresholds set; test alert observed end-to-end | | |
| **Incident profile** — service-level incident triggers & severities registered with the incident-management process | | |
| **Supportability / handover** — support model agreed; runbook accepted by operators; team ready; training done; **continuity** assured (knowledge captured, not reliant on one person) | | |
| **Cost / licensing** — licences in place; ongoing run-cost confirmed and owned | | |

## 2. Outstanding remediation

*List any criterion not yet met, the action required, and the owner/date. The record is re-presented when these are closed.*

| Criterion | Action required | Owner | Target date |
| --------- | --------------- | ----- | ----------- |
|           |                 |       |             |
