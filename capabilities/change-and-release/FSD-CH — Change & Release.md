# FSD-CH — Change & Release

*Capability card. FitSD governs change; it doesn't reinvent it.*

> **What a capability card is.** A one-page orientation, not a process. It says what the capability is for, which requirements it carries, what to satisfy them *with* — because here FitSD points at existing practice rather than authoring its own — and how it wires into Solution Development. Solution Development is the only capability FitSD builds out in full. The other four, this one included, are requirements plus a pointer.

## Objective

Keep changes to live services moving — quickly, in small batches, without breaking things. Change is where most outages are born, and where most teams pick the wrong poison: over-control until everything grinds to a halt, or under-control until they live in firefight. The job is to find the weight of control that's just enough, and no more.

## Scope

**In:** any change to a live service — config, code, infrastructure, a release. **Out:** net-new services and significant new capabilities. Those come through Solution Development first and only hand the *build* changes back here. The dividing line is the scope test in `FSD-PRO §1`.

## Requirements it carries (Tier 1)

- **FSD-CH-1** — changes assessed for risk and impact before they happen.
- **FSD-CH-2** — authorised by someone appropriate to the risk (standard / normal / major).
- **FSD-CH-3** — recorded, and the significant ones reviewed afterwards.
- **FSD-CH-4** — releases deployed in a controlled, repeatable and, where feasible, reversible way.

## How to satisfy them

FitSD ships no change process. Use one you already have, or adopt an external one:

- **FitSM PR12 (Change Management) + PR13 (Release & Deployment)** — the closest lightweight fit.
- **ITIL 4 Change Enablement, Deployment, and Release Management** — if you already live in the ITIL world.
- **Your own CAB / change process** — if it works, keep it. FitSD only asks that FSD-CH-1…4 are met and you can show it.

## Where it meets Solution Development

This is the hand-off. When Gate 2 approves a build, the work isn't built *inside* Solution Development — the build and deployment changes are raised and run here, through FSD-CH. Two threads tie them together:

- Every solution that goes live becomes a thing that then gets *changed*. The change record is the ongoing story after Service Acceptance.
- The Definition of Done already expects a deployment that's repeatable and reversible — the same instinct as FSD-CH-4. The two reinforce each other.

## The flow lens

Change is the beating heart of *The Phoenix Project* for a reason: it's where flow lives or dies. Three ideas are worth stealing, and none of them needs a heavy process.

- **Small batches.** Many small, low-risk changes beat the occasional terrifying big one. Bias toward frequent and boring.
- **Make it visible.** A change you can see is a change you can sequence. The same gate-record habit FitSD uses at intake works for changes in flight.
- **The right weight.** Too much approval kills throughput; too little brings the 2 a.m. call. "Standard," pre-approved changes exist precisely so the routine stuff doesn't queue behind a board.

There's a deeper link, too. FitSD's whole intake model is *Theory of Constraints* in disguise — the gates are a limit on work in progress, so the team's constraint isn't drowned. Change is the same idea one step downstream: protect flow by controlling batch size and risk, not by piling on sign-offs.

**The metric that matters: change-fail rate** — the share of changes that cause a degradation or need remediation. It's one of the four **DORA** measures, alongside lead time for change, deployment frequency, and time to restore service. Watch those four and you're measuring flow the way *The Goal*, *Velocity* and *Accelerate* argue you should: fast *and* stable, not one bought at the cost of the other.

## Maturity, briefly

- **0–1** — changes happen; nobody's quite sure who approved what.
- **2–3** — a defined, followed change path, with pre-approved standard changes for the routine stuff.
- **4–5** — change-fail rate and lead time are watched, and trending the right way.

(Full 0–5 scale in the Charter, §7.)
