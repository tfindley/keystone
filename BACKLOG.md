# FitSD — Backlog

Deferred ideas and improvements surfaced while building the framework, many from dogfooding it on a real project. Not yet scheduled.

## Framework tiers

- **Tier 3 — Roles model.** Canonical role definitions, authority levels, and a light RACI across the five capabilities; reconciles Solution Owner (FSD-PRO §3) with Service Owner (Charter §6). Guidepost in the `Roadmap`.
- **Tier 5 — Maturity self-check.** The 0–5 capability self-assessment described in the Charter (§7). Most of the content already exists in the cards' "Maturity, briefly" thumbnails. Guidepost in the `Roadmap`.

## Principles

- **Openness / honest disclosure (candidate principle).** Consider whether FitSD should state a value of being open about how a service is built and run — its tooling, dependencies, and methods (including AI assistance) — beyond the existing "documented & evidenced" bar. Surfaced while writing the site's AI-assisted disclosure: the page espouses openness, but FitSD's seven principles (Charter §3) don't name it. A deliberate call, not a quiet add — likely a normative change (see `Versioning Policy`).

## Capabilities

- **FSD-SC — Supplier / supply-chain capability.** Requirements + reference, closing NIS2 21(2)(d) and mapping ISO 27001 A.5.19–A.5.22, FitSM PR8. Threads into Solution Development at Gate 2 (supplier assessment) and Service Acceptance.

## Solution Development

- **SAC sample *values* + topic guidance.** Per-criterion "how to write a good X criterion" notes and worked *threshold values*. The SAC *structure* shipped in v0.3 (defined once as inheritable principles + a blank baseline template); the sample values stay *deferred until a worked example has landed*, so they're real, not invented.

## Scope & the wider family

Direction set while scoping v0.3 (fuller narrative in the `Roadmap`, "Shape & scope"). Candidates and boundaries — not yet scheduled.

- **Service Level Management (candidate thin requirement).** A *thin* `shall` — each live service has agreed, recorded service levels (or an explicit "best effort" statement) with its customer. Closes the FitSM PR2 gap without building an SLM process; the availability SLO already lives in the SAC. Reference-out for the *how*.
- **Service Reporting (candidate thin requirement).** A *thin* `shall` — service performance is reported to stakeholders at a defined cadence (could fold into the FSD-GV-5 review). Closes the FitSM PR3 gap. Reference-out for the *how*.
- **Declared non-goals.** Full Configuration Management / CMDB (FitSM PR11), Customer Relationship Management (PR7), and capacity-as-a-discipline stay out of scope — met by "use your existing practice." Worth stating explicitly so the boundary is deliberate, not accidental.
- **Shared core (only if the family grows).** FitSD currently double-hats as the umbrella frame (five capabilities + requirements spine + definitions — the `FSD-` prefix on everything) *and* the Solution Development deep-dive. If a second "Fit-" deep-dive (Change, Incident) becomes real, extract a shared core so siblings reference the frame rather than redefine it.

## Done (recent)

- ~~SAC as inheritable principles (v0.3)~~ — SAC reframed as standing, org-tunable categories with a ratifiable baseline (new `reference/FitSD — Service Acceptance Criteria`); new requirement **FSD-GV-7** (define & inherit the baseline); SAC now defined once and referenced by name across FSD-PRO/FRM-02/FRM-03 (drift cure). *(2026-07-01)*
- ~~Idea Brief becomes a canonical form (v0.3)~~ — **FSD-FRM-00**, a thin one-page intake; carries forward into Gate 1; closes the "no Idea Brief form" gap. *(2026-07-01)*
- ~~Business Implementation Guide (v0.3)~~ — new `FitSD — Implementation Guide` (stand-up checklist, implementation profile, minimal roles) — the "how do we stand this up here?" layer. *(2026-07-01)*
- ~~Gate 2 "selected option" field (v0.3)~~ — explicit "Selected option + evaluation reference" on FSD-FRM-02; plus §4/§5 Monitoring de-dup and FSD-PRO §4/§8 de-dup. *(2026-07-01)*
- ~~Lifecycle completion & information-stores layer (v0.2)~~ — FSD-RR-7 (end-of-life review & retirement); FSD-GV-4 broadened (demand pipeline + retained history); continuity added to the SAC; new-technology intake trigger + Gate 1 vendor due-diligence; new `reference/FitSD — Information Stores` + Diagrams §6; tier model reframed into Framework / Implementation layers. *(2026-06-23)*
- ~~Consistency pass (v0.1 review)~~ — added the sixth demand family (Finance & people) to the context diagrams; synced the Gate 2 "rework" edge label across both gate-flow diagrams; reconciled the "sixth capability" wording in Charter §4 with the FSD-SC plan; gitignored `.repowise/` and `.claude/settings.local.json`. *(2026-06-23)*
- ~~De-number the SAC~~ — removed the hardcoded count from prose and the `#` column; criteria referenced by name. *(2026-06-22)*
- ~~Split SAC "Monitoring, alerting & incident triggers"~~ — now **Monitoring & alerting** and **Incident profile** as separate criteria. *(2026-06-22)*
- ~~Compliance/risk driver in Gate 1~~ — primary driver + Risk/Compliance value lens. *(2026-06-22)*
- ~~Gate 2 timeline & effort element~~ — milestones + person-days by role (not FTE). *(2026-06-22)*
- ~~Service-level incident profile~~ — FSD-RR-6 + SAC criterion. *(2026-06-22)*
- ~~Capability cards for GV / CH / RR / SA~~ — one-page reference cards (objective, requirements, how-to-satisfy, SD hand-off, flow lens). Plus `reference/FitSD — Influences`. *(2026-06-22)*
